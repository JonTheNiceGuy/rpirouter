# Raspberry Pi Router

This repo is designed to take a Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W, or 4, and turn it into at least an
[attached network interface](https://github.com/JonTheNiceGuy/rpirouter/tree/StateInterfaceUpOnly),
but more likely, a [router](https://github.com/JonTheNiceGuy/rpirouter/tree/StateRouter) (sadly,
not the Zero), or even a hardware VPN appliance.

This branch is bare, aside from this README. Separate blog posts have been created for each state
of this repo.

* [Interface Only](https://jon.sprig.gs/blog/post/2243)
